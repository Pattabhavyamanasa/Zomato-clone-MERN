Developed as a learning exercise and a portfolio piece, this clone showcases expertise in modern web development stacks, database management, and UI/UX design principles.

Features
Restaurant Listing & Discovery: Browse a wide range of restaurants with detailed profiles.
Menu Browse: View categorized menus, item details, and pricing.
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login.
Search & Filters: Efficiently search for restaurants by name, cuisine, location, or apply various filters.
Shopping Cart: Add, update, and remove food items before placing an order.
Order Placement: Simulate the process of placing a food order.
Responsive Design: Optimized for a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
[Add any unique features your clone has, e.g., Admin Panel, Basic Order Tracking]

[MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL]: (e.g., MongoDB) - Database to store restaurant, menu, user, and order data.
[Mongoose / Sequelize / Prisma]: (e.g., Mongoose) - ODM/ORM for simplified database interactions.
[JWT (JSON Web Tokens)]: For secure user authentication.
Deployment & Tools:

[Git / GitHub]: Version control.
[VS Code]: Integrated Development Environment.
[Netlify / Vercel / Render / Heroku / AWS]: (e.g., Render for backend, Netlify for frontend) - Deployment platforms.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Zomato clone locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn: (Comes with Node.js, or https://yarnpkg.com/)
[Your Database]: (e.g., MongoDB Community Server or access to a MongoDB Atlas cloud instance)
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Ahaan-2618/Zomato-clone.git]
cd Zomato-clone # Or the actual folder name if it's different
Backend Setup:
Navigate into the backend directory (e.g., server, api):

Bash

cd server # or api, backend, etc.
npm install # or yarn install
Create a .env file in the server directory and add your environment variables.

PORT=[Your Backend Port, e.g., 5000]
MONGO_URI=[Your MongoDB Connection String]
JWT_SECRET=[A strong, random secret key for JWT]
# Add any other necessary API keys or sensitive data
Frontend Setup:
Navigate into the frontend directory (e.g., client, web):

Bash

cd ../client # Adjust path if your frontend isn't directly inside the root
npm install # or yarn install
Create a .env file in the client directory and add your environment variables.

REACT_APP_API_URL=[Your Backend URL, e.g., http://localhost:5000/api]
# Add any other client-side environment variables if needed
Run the Applications:

Start the Backend Server:
In the server directory:

Bash

Start the Frontend Development Server:
In the client directory:

Bash

npm start # or yarn start
The frontend should open in your default browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend are running:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (or your frontend's port).
Register a new user account.
Explore the list of restaurants, browse menus, and simulate placing an order.
Test different search and filter functionalities.
